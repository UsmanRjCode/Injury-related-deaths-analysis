Injury-Related Deaths (2000–2019): A Global Perspective

Overview

This project explores how causes of death by injuries have changed across countries over time, focusing on the years 2000, 2010, 2015, and 2019. The goal is to raise public awareness about injury-related deaths and analyze trends using open data.

As a beginner data analyst, I used basic descriptive statistics and visual comparisons to understand patterns and shifts in injury-related mortality globally.

Motivation

I chose this topic because public health is a critical concern worldwide, and understanding causes of death—especially from injuries—can help guide policy and individual awareness. Injury-related deaths are often preventable, and studying them can inform governments and communities about where action is needed.

Data Source

Dataset: Cause of Death by Injury (% of total deaths)

Source: World Bank Data360

Years analyzed: 2000, 2010, 2015, and 2019

Countries covered: Global dataset


Tools Used

Microsoft Excel – for data cleaning, calculations, and tabular analysis

Tableau – for interactive data visualizations and dashboards


Methods

I applied simple analysis techniques:

Descriptive Statistics: Calculated average, standard deviation, and percentage change

Comparative Analysis: Compared countries across different years

Trend Observation: Identified peaks and drops in injury-related deaths


Key Findings

2015 recorded the highest global injury-related death rate among the selected years.

Countries like the United States, Canada, Brazil, and Russia consistently showed lower injury-related death rates.

Estonia had the highest injury-related death rate in both 2000 and 2019.

Haiti (2010) and Syria (2015) were leading in injury-related deaths during their respective years.

Some countries showed a negative percentage change, indicating a significant decline in deaths caused by injuries over time.

Countries like Jamaica (2000–2010) and Malta (2015–2019) had the lowest rates of injury-related deaths.


Takeaways

If you live in or work with countries that show high injury-related death rates, awareness and preventive actions are vital.

Governments in high-risk countries should invest in safety measures, healthcare infrastructure, and public education to reduce preventable injuries.


For Recruiters

This project represents one of my first steps into data analytics. While it's simple, it demonstrates:

My ability to collect and clean real-world data

Use of basic statistical analysis

Creation of visual storytelling using Tableau

An interest in real-world, socially relevant questions


I welcome feedback and look forward to growing my skills through more advanced analyses.
